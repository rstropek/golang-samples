Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.

Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power. on your home planet of Alderaan.

Maybe they know what happened. It's an Imperial fighter. It followed us! No. It's a short range fighter. There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? It sure is leaving in a big hurry.

Negative! It didn't go in. It just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point. oh-five, we'll cover for you.

If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. Didn't we just leave this party? What kept you? We ran into some old friends. Is the ship all right? Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. Look! Come on, Artoo, we're going! Now's our chance! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Luke, its too late! Blast the door! Kid! Run, Luke! Run! I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships.
